  <p>A desktop computer is a computer that fits on or under a desk. 
    They utilize peripheral devices for interaction, such as a keyboard and mouse for input,
     and display devices like a monitor, projector, or television.
      Desktop computers can have a horizontal or vertical (tower) form factor, or be combined with a monitor to create an All-in-One computer. Unlike a laptop, which is portable, 
    desktop computers are generally made to stay at one location.</p>
